Mobile application for easy interaction between the client and the courier..

Welcome to the Mobile Android Application for easy interaction between the client and the courier project! This project focuses on developing a robust mobile application for Android devices. Leveraging modern technologies and best practices, we aim to create a seamless user experience while adhering to clean architecture principles.

Technology Stack
Kotlin: Kotlin serves as the primary language for building the application logic. With its concise syntax and powerful features, Kotlin enables efficient and expressive code.

Android SDK: The Android SDK provides essential tools and libraries for Android app development. We utilize the SDK to handle various aspects of mobile development, including UI components, user interactions, and device compatibility.

Jetpack Compose: Jetpack Compose revolutionizes UI development for Android apps by offering a modern and declarative approach. With Compose, we can build dynamic and interactive user interfaces efficiently, resulting in a more streamlined development process.

Retrofit: Retrofit is a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java. It facilitates seamless communication with the server by handling network requests and responses efficiently. We use Retrofit to implement client-server interactions and consume data from our special API server.

Coil: Coil is a lightweight image loading library for Android, designed for simplicity and performance. It offers features such as memory caching and automatic request cancellation, ensuring efficient loading and display of images in the application.

Client-Server Interaction
The project involves developing robust client-server interaction with a special API server. The API server provides endpoints for accessing and manipulating data relevant to the application's functionality. We utilize Retrofit to establish communication with the server, exchanging data in a structured format (e.g., JSON) over HTTP.

Clean Architecture
The project follows clean architecture principles to ensure maintainability, testability, and scalability. By separating concerns into distinct layers (e.g., presentation, domain, data), we achieve a modular and flexible architecture that promotes code reuse and simplifies maintenance.
